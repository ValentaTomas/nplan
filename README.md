# NPLAN - a simple journal system for mac

- package it manually as a binary with 'pkg'
- save journal folder into config
- [TODO] automatically sync with git repo
- [TODO] allow selection of archived journals with <<, and with direct date
- [TODO] allow syntax for cross-day tasks - automatically copy entries starting with "*", if they were not marked as completed (copy not just from previous day, but keep track of all active tasks)
